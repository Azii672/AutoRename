# AutoRename

This Chrome extension (also supported on Chromium Edge) fixes the problem where saving images from Twitter would generate a randomized string of letters and numbers as it's file name. It uses this formula: 

`[Twitter username] [Tweet ID] [Random 8 string].` 

Check out the screenshot below for a BEFORE and AFTER. I'll hopefully expand this extension beyond just Twitter, as well as more options to customize your file names in a neatly manner.
